# Locale files are stored in config/locales directory and are automatically loaded by
# MVC-ExEngine, you can set the application default in the eemvc.php file in config
# by adding the following in the ApplicationInit function: $this->DefaultLocale = 'en';
# then you can use in any controller with `I18n->t`:
#
#   $this->I18n->t('hello', 'default value');
#
# or in any view:
#
#   <?=$I18n->t('hello', 'default value')?>
#
# you can set any locale file in runtime by setting
#
#   $this->I18n->changeLocale('es');
#
# This will use data from the es.yml file.
#
# Also you can populate this file @ runtime, just set $this->I18n->autoAdd = true; or in configuration:
# $this->AutomaticLocalePopulate = true, MVC-ExEngine will automatically add the missing locale words with
# the default value.
#
# Also if you have more locale files (i.e. en.yml, es.yml, it.yml, fr.yml, etc.) MVC-ExEngine by default will add
# the missing words with the default value, so you can easily translate the files later.
# You can disable non-default locale file population by setting: $this->PopulateAllLocales = false; in the config file.
