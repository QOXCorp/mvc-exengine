# Adding css files for your app is easy, just set them like this:
#
#   - src:  "mycss"
#
# If the font file is stored in static/fonts, if css loading is from a composer package you set like this:
#
#   - src:  "mycssfromcomposer"
#     package: "css-vendor/vendor-pkg"
#
# Or if the font will be loaded from other URL:
#
#   - src:  "//mycdn.myhost.com/css/cssfile.min.css"
#     remote: true
#
# Thats it :)

- src: "styles"
