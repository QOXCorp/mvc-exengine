MVC-ExEngine

First steps to start a new MVC application

0. Install ExEngine Framework (7.0.8.41+) in lib/exengine, cd there and do `git clone https://github.com/QOXCorp/exengine.git`.
1. Set Correctly the ExEngine paths in the config/exengine.php file (just the http_path is necessary almost all the times).
2. Create a controller manually (in the app/controllers folder) or using mvctool:
	- On Linux/OS X/Unix (bash-based):
		source ./bin/mvc
		mvctool -g controller start
	- On Windows (PHP binary must be on the Path environment variable):
		bin\mvc
		mvctool -g controller start
3. Test your installation, http://localhost/
