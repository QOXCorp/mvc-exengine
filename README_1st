MVC-ExEngine

First steps to start a new MVC application

Recommendation: For a best performing MVC-ExEngine installation that you enable short_open_tags in your php.ini file.

Requirements:
- Apache or PHP-FPM compatible web server.
- PHP 5.4+

0. Install ExEngine Framework (7.0.8.42+) in lib/exengine, cd there and do `git clone https://github.com/QOXCorp/exengine.git`.
1. Set Correctly the ExEngine paths in the config/exengine.php file (just the http_path is necessary almost all the times).
2. Create a controller manually (in the app/controllers folder) or using mvctool:
	- On Linux/OS X/Unix (bash-based):
		source ./bin/mvc
		mvctool -g controller start
	- On Windows (PHP binary must be on the Path environment variable):
		bin\mvc
		mvctool -g controller start
	- Or using the web interface:
		bin\mvc
		mvctool -wu
		open the web interface at: http://localhost:8989/
3. Test your installation, http://localhost/

To enable pretty-url'ing:
    - If using Apache2+:
        Open your site configuration, usually in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default and set to allow overrides.
        Remember to restart your server after configuration change.
    - Open the MVC-ExEngine configuration file: config/eemvc.php and add this line inside ApplicationInit:
        $this->RewriteRulesEnabled = true;
    - All framework-based links will be converted to pretty urls.
