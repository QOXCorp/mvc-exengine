# Locale files are stored in config/locales directory and are automatically loaded by
# MVC-ExEngine, you can set the application default in the eemvc.php file in config
# by adding the following in the ApplicationInit function: $this->DefaultLocale = 'en';
# then you can use in any controller with `I18n->t`:
#
#   $this->I18n->t('hello');
#
# or in any view:
#
#   <?=$I18n->t('hello')?>
#
# you can set any locale file in runtime by setting
#
#   $this->I18n->changeLocale('es');
#
# This will use data from the es.yml file.

Hello World: "Hello World English"
